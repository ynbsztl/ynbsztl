We have synthesized two types of carbon quantum dots: red-emitting and blue-emitting. By combining them, we can test the concentration of specific metal ions. <img src="/images/cds.png" alt="Two kinds of Cds" height="350"/>


This project was a collaborative effort with Yi Liu, Yufan Wang, and Maoyuan Ye, under the guidance of Yihua Zhou.
