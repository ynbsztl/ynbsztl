excerpt: 'Abstract: This study evaluates the impacts of a tuberculosis (TB) control program in China. TB remained a
public health threat in China in early 1990s, the Chinese Government introduced a comprehensive control
program that incorporated the Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course across 13 provinces during 1992
and 2001. Our study demonstrates the program reduces TB infection rates. Results regarding sickness, child
care provision, and employment exhibit a diverse contemporaneous pattern across different age groups and
urban-rural heterogeneity. The effect of the program spillover to the subsequent generation by increasing
high school completion rate. The cost-benefit analysis demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the program.'
