excerpt: 'Abstract: This study investigates the short- and long-term health effects of in-utero exposure to a Tuberculosis (TB) control program. In the 1990s, China was one of the 22 high burden countries, accounting for approximately one-sixth of all new cases worldwide. The Chinese government implemented a comprehensive TB control program during this period, which is considered the largest TB control campaign in the 20th century. By combining two social survey datasets, our findings indicate that individuals exposed to the program while in utero exhibited reduced likelihoods of outpatient visits, overweight, and sickness among rural males in their adulthood; however, no significant effects were observed among urban samples. An analysis conducted in rural areas indicates short-term health impacts on both cohorts exposed during pregnancy and contemporaneous adults at childbearing age. Notably, the study found no discernible effect on household income. In conclusion, our research reveals a substantial positive impact resulting from in-utero exposure to TB control program, and the underlying mechanisms driving these effects.'
