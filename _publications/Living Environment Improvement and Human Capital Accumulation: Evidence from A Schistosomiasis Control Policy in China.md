excerpt: "Abstract: This study investigates the long and short-term effects of China's comprehensive control and prevention policy implemented in 2006 ('2006 policy' hereafter) targeting schistosomiasis, one of the seven most prevalent Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The 2006 policy, a public health policy that emphasizes infectious source control, improves living environmental conditions and reduces schistosomiasis prevalence. Regarding long-term outcomes, we observe mixed results with significant gender heterogeneity including a decrease in hospitalization likelihood among males while an increase in feeling sick incidence, a decrease in junior high school completion probability and an increase in employment rates among females. Short-term analysis reveals that boys exhibit lower sickness likelihood while girls show higher sickness likelihood. Furthermore, girls are less likely to enroll in school and more likely to work. An increased access to toilets may be a potential explanation for the observed effects."
