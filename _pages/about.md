Hi! I am a third-year master student at [**Wuhan University**](https://whu.edu.cn). Where I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. Min Guo.

Prior to Wuhan University, I earned my Bachelor's degree from [**Printing and Package School, Wuhan University**](https://pps.whu.edu.cn/zxgk/zxjj.htm) and [**Economics and Management School, Wuhan University**](https://ems.whu.edu.cn/English.htm) in June 2021. I am extremely grateful to [**Prof. Yihua Zhou**](https://sns.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/20143.htm), **Prof. Min Guo**, **Dr. Jingwei Huang**, and [**Prof. Xun Li**](https://sites.google.com/site/xlihomepage/) who introduced me to the world of Printing and Economics!

My research interests lie broadly in **Health Economics** -- check my [**publications**](publications) or [**CV (PDF)**](CV_Tianlei.pdf) for more information. I am open to other topics as well; feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to chat!
